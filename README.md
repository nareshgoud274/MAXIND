# MAXIND


Things required : 

1) Qiskit. 

 Follow https://qiskit.org/documentation/install.html to install. 

2) Jupyter notebook 

3) Activate the environment in which qiskit and Jupyter notebook are installed 

Download the MAXIND jupyter notebook and run cell by cell. 

Problem Input : Graph G - (V, E) as input. V is the set of nodes in the graph and E is the set of edges in the graph.
You may find it helpful to read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Independent_set_(graph_theory) to know more about Independent set of a graph.  
Problem output : Size of the maximum independent set. 

Only things that need to be changed are 

1) n = # 
2) elist = [] # in the code for your choice of graph. 

Notice the Max independent set is NP-Complete problem. So it is hard problem in the sense we do not know any efficient algorithm to compute the max independent set for a general graph.
